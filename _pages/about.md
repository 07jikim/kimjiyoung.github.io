I am **Ji-Young Kim**, a graduate student at Jeonbuk National University in South Korea.  
My research focuses on **virusâ€“hostâ€“microbiome interactions** in insects, especially the virome of sap-feeding pests such as *Varroa destructor* and mealybugs. I apply **high-throughput sequencing (HTS)** and **bioinformatics** to study how viral infections shape microbial ecosystems and affect host physiology.

### ðŸ”¬ My Current Work Involves:
- ðŸ“Š Virome analysis using RNA-seq and small RNA-seq  
- ðŸ”¬ Exploring horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between viruses and hosts  
- ðŸ§¬ Investigating insect microbiome diversity  
- ðŸŒ± Studying ecological interactions in agroecosystems  

I aim to better understand the **evolutionary dynamics of viruses** and their role in shaping insectâ€“hostâ€“symbiont relationships.
